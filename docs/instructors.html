                <p>
                    Prior to this role, I've been a Teaching Assistant for both Data Structures and Introduction to Java. Additionally, I had the privilege of contributing in CS as a researcher during my internship at Harvard University’s engineering department. Outside of the academic world, I cherish spending quality time with my family, diving into a good book, and going for runs. I'm truly passionate about this course, and I look forward to guiding you through an exciting semester of learning at Columbia!
